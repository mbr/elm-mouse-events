{-| Offers MouseEvents that expose more information about these events than
`elm-lang/html`.

Specifically, the position of mouse events can be determined precisely as
client coordinates and element (`targetPos`) coordinates are included.

# Example

```elm
import MouseEvents exposing (onMouseMove)

type Msg =
    Clicked MouseEvent

div
  [ onClick MouseMove ]
  [ text "Example div" ]
```

The `Clicked` message will contain the coordinates of the click.

{-| A mouse event, maps to the JS event with the same name. See

Note that `onMouseEnter` and other events may be prone to strange behaviour
similar to [Z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting) they overlap
while no `z-index` style attribute is set.
